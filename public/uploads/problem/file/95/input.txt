A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
A little learning is a dangerous thing.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
A leopard cannot change his spots.
A problem shared is a problem halved.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Actions speak louder than words.
After death, to call the doctor.
All that glitters is not gold.
Never judge by appearances. Don't judge a book by its cover.
As you sow, so shall you reap.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Better late than never.
Blood is thicker than water.
By other's faults wise men correct their own.
Do to others as you would be done by.
Don't count your chickens before they are hatched.
Don't cry before you are hurt.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Easier said than done.
Every dog has his day.
Every man knows his own business best.
Everybody's business is nobody's business.
Hunger is the best sauce.
Ignorance is bliss.
It never rains but it pours.
Misfortunes seldom come singly.
It's the nature of water to run downhill.
Like father, like sun.
Look before you leap.
Many drops make a shower.
Water will wear away stone.
More haste, less speed.
No news is good news.
No pains, no gains.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
One cannot eat one's cake and have it.
One man's music is another man's noise.
One swallow doesn't make a summer.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Practice makes perfect.
Rome was not built in a day.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Still waters run deep.
Strike while the iron is hot.
Make hay while the sun shines.
The grass is greener on the other side of the fence.
The pot calls the kettle black.
There is no place like home.
Time flies like an arrow.
Time and tide wait for no man.
Time is the healer of all.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Two heads are better than one.
Well begun is half done.
What's done cannot be undone.
Don't cry over spilt milk.
When the well's dry, we know the worth of water.
Bad news travels fast.
Better late than never.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Charity begins at home.
Do in Rome as the Romans do.
Do to others as you would be done by.
Easier said than done.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Fine feathers make fine birds.
First comes, first served.
Good luck alternates with misfortune.
Heaven helps those who help themselves.
Lend your money and lose your friend.
Never judge by appearance.
No rule without exception.
No smoke without fire.
The more, the better.
The more you get, the more you want.
A sound mind in a sound body.
A bad workman always blames his tools.
A burnt child dreads the fire.
A good beginning makes a good ending.
A good medicine tastes bitter.
A good neighbor is better than a brother far off.
A leopard cannot change his spots.
A loaf of bread is better than the song of many birds.
A miss is as good as a mile.
